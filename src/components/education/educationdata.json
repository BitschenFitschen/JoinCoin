      "question01": "What Is A Cryptocurrency?",
      "answer01": "A cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency that uses cryptography for security. Transactions are made with no middle men – meaning, no banks. A defining feature of a cryptocurrency, it is not issued by any central authority, rendering it theoretically immune to government interference or manipulation.

The first cryptocurrency to capture the public imagination was Bitcoin, which was launched in 2009 by an individual or group known under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto.",

      "answer01": "More and more restaurants, online e-commerce sites, booking sites like Expedia, and can even purchase gift cards! Lots of gift card businesses accept bitcoins and that can be used at a surprising number of major retailers like Walmart, Amazon, Target and Nike!",
      "question02": "Is Cryptocurrency In The USA?",
      "answer02": "Gift Card Companies like Gyft, eGifter, iTradeBTC and GiftCardZen provide widest range of options., but many gift cards are only valid in their country of issue.You will  pay a little more to trade your bitcoins for gift cards,but  you don’t have to deal with exchanges or transfers.",
      "question03": "Will Cryptocurrency Go Away Soon?",
      "answer03": "Do you think the internet will go away soon? This is just the beginning of cryptocurrency. As globalization continues, the world will look for a consistent currency for all nations. IT’S ONLY THE BEGINNING!",

      "question01": "Are Purchases Anonymous?",
      "answer01": "Each transaction is recorded in a public log (the blockchain: We’ll get to that shortly). Names of buyers and sellers are never revealed! While that keeps bitcoin users’ transactions private, it also lets them buy or sell anything without tracing it back to them.",
      "question02": "Where Are My Coins Stored?",
      "answer02": "In your wallet on the blockchain! Think of it like direct deposit to your bank from your work. No actual paper money is exchanged or even seen, rather a transaction history of money/currency transferred and your account with a specific, private ID that reflects the new value!",
      "question03": "What are the drawbacks of Cryptocurrency?",
      "answer03": "Cryptocurrencies are virtual and do not have a central repository, a digital cryptocurrency balance can be wiped out by a computer crash if a backup copy of the holdings does not exist. Since prices are based on supply and demand, the rate at which a cryptocurrency can be exchanged for another currency can fluctuate widely. Cryptocurrencies are not immune to the threat of hacking. In Bitcoin's short history, the company has been subject to over 40 thefts, including a few that exceeded $1 million in value.",

      "question01": "What Is A Blockchain?",
      "answer01": "Remember the global list of transactions? That’s it! A transaction database, a full copy of a currency's block chain contains every transaction ever executed in the currency.",
      "question02": "How Is the Blockchain being measure?",
      "answer02": "'Length' is calculated as total combined difficulty of that chain, not number of blocks, though this distinction is only important in the context of a few potential attacks. A chain is valid if all of the blocks and transactions within it are valid, and only if it starts with the genesis block.",
      "question03": "Want To Know More?",
      "answer03": "Every block contains a hash of the previous block. Each block is guaranteed to come after the previous block chronologically because the previous block's hash would otherwise not be known. Each block is also computationally impractical to modify once it has been in the chain because every block after it would also have to be regenerated. These properties are what make bitcoins transactions irreversible.",

      "question01": "Woahhh There Tiger!",
      "answer01": "While mining is integral to cryptocurrency, we’re going to stick to the basic ins and outs before we turn you into a algorithm-programming-software-engineering-minor (yes that is the correct term…)",
      "question02": "Where do individual start mining? ",
      "answer02": "On their computer, computer can help solve or verify math problems’ answers within the community! ",
      "question03": "Who is providing the bit coins for solving these math problems ?",
      "answer03": "Everyone in the mining community. When someone is mining a bitcoin, what he is actually doing is validating a bitcoin that has already been mined by another person. What this means is that when a miner named MinerJoe solves a complex math problem, MinerJoe does not get a bitcoin right away, the only way to trust that MinerJoe's solution is correct and NOT FAKE is to ask ALL OTHER miners to compute the same problem as MinerJoe's and see if his solution was indeed correct. Once ALL OTHER miners have successfully determined that the MinerJoe's solution was correct, MinerJoe automatically earns 1 bitcoin. No one GIVES MinerJoe that 1 bitcoin. MinerJoe AUTOMATICALLY gets the 1 bitcoin after his solution has been determined VALID by ALL OTHER miners due to the bitcoin mining PROTOCOL which is a decentralized architecture, that's what decentralization means.",
