Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.",

      "question01": "Are Purchases Anonymous?",
      "answer01": "Each transaction is recorded in a public log(the blockchain: We’ll get to that shortly).Names of buyers and sellers are never revealed! While that keeps bitcoin users’ transactions private, it also lets them buy or sell anything without tracing it back to them.",
      "question02": "Where Are My Coins Stored?",
      "answer02": "In your wallet on the blockchain! Think of it like direct deposit to your bank from your work. No actual paper money is exchanged or even seen, rather a transaction history of money/currency transferred and your account with a specific, private ID that reflects the new value!",
      "question03": "What are the drawbacks of Cryptocurrency?",
      "answer03": "Cryptocurrencies are virtual and do not have a central repository, a digital cryptocurrency balance can be wiped out by a computer crash if a backup copy of the holdings does not exist. Since prices are based on supply and demand, the rate at which a cryptocurrency can be exchanged for another currency can fluctuate widely. Cryptocurrencies are not immune to the threat of hacking. In Bitcoin's short history, the company has been subject to over 40 thefts, including a few that exceeded $1 million in value.",
